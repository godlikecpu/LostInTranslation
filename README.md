# Lost In Translation

## Lost in translation is a web application based on React.js where the user can translate English words and short sentences to American sign language.

## Features:

<b>Startup page:</b> which is also the Login page. The user can enter his name and login to the main page. The name is stored in the local-storage.

<b>Translation page:</b> the user can input Englis words or short sentences to translate to American sign language. The user can save up to 10 translations. If there is already 10 translations in the local storage the oldest translation is replaced with the new one. 

In the translation box the corresponding Sign language characters appear. The user can navigate to the profile page after saving the translations. There is a limit of 50 characters for the user input.

<b>Profile page:</b> it displays the 10 translations with text and the corresponding Sign characters that are stored in the local storage. The user can delete all the translations from the local storage. The user can logout and in that case the user will be redirected to the Login page and the username will be deleted from the local storage.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
